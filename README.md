Serum Game Concept

# Starting with the Cube Engine by WVO - because it's codebase is tiny, and it'll likely do the job

Aliens vs Humans, but blood is the weapon against the other race (Hence Serum weapons patched into user)

If serum of both types combine on a surface, a new being evolves (The Serumoid)

These serumoid's are intelligent, and although they only can become 6 parts (Bone, Wing, Knuckle, Eye, Skin or Tooth), they can
combine to form fearsome, problem solving creatures that will absorb any being they contact - alien or human.

Well, that's the rough idea, anyway...
